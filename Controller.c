/*==============================================================================================================
 * Static function declarations.
 *
 * A "static" function is one that has scope of the source code file. You can think of the word "static" in
 * this context as meaning "private". A static function cannot be called from any function in any other source
 * code file. Static functions are intended to only be called by the functions in the source code file in which
 * the static function is defined. Functions should always be static unless they have to be nonstatic. When
 * does a function have to be nonstatic? When it is intended to be called by a function in some other source
 * code file.
 *
 * Note that C requires a function to either be DECLARED or DEFINED before it is called. Consider,
 *
 * Foo.c
 * -----
 * ... code here, it does not matter what it does.
 * static void SomeFunction()  -- This is the DEFINITION of SomeFunction.
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * void SomeOtherFunction()
 * {
 *     ...
 *     SomeFunction();  -- Okay because SomeFunction is DEFINED before the call.
 * }
 *
 * The reason is that the compiler must know three things about the function being called in order to generate
 * the assembly language code to call the function. These three things are: (1) the name of the function; (2)
 * the number and data types of the function parameters; and (3) the data type of the return value. In the
 * example above, when the compiler encounters SomeFunction() it sees and remembers all three of those things.
 * Later when it sees the function call in SomeOtherFuncion() it has all the information it needs to be able
 * to generate the code to call SomeFunction().
 *
 * We would have a problem if these functions were reversed, e.g.,
 *
 * Foo.c
 * -----
 * ... code here, it does not matter what it does.
 *
 * void SomeOtherFunction()
 * {
 *     ...
 *     SomeFunction();  -- Not okay because SomeFunction has not been DEFINED or DECLARED before the call.
 * }
 *
 * static void SomeFunction()  -- This is the definition of SomeFunction.
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * Since the compiler reads the source code from top to bottom, left to right, when it sees the call to
 * SomeFunction() inside SomeOtherFunction() it HAS NOT SEEN SomeFunction() yet, so it does not know: (1) the
 * name of the function being called; (2) the number and data types of the function parameters; and (3) the
 * data type of the return value. Therefore, it cannot generate the code to call SomeFunction() and you get
 * a syntax error (which will be something to the effect that SomeFunction() is undefined). One way to fix
 * this, as we have already seen, is to reverse the order of the functions. The second way is to write a
 * DECLARATION for SomeFunction() above the function call to it, e.g.,
 *
 * Foo.c
 * -----
 * ... code here, it does not matter what it does.
 *
 * static void SomeFunction();  -- This is A DECLARATION of SomeFunction.
 *
 * void SomeOtherFunction()
 * {
 *     ...
 *     SomeFunction();  -- Okay because SomeFunction is DECLARED before the call.
 * }
 *
 * static void SomeFunction()  -- This is the definition of SomeFunction.
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * Burger's Rule For Ordering Functions in a Source Code File: I always write the functions in a source code
 * file in alphabetical order, without regard to letter case. This makes it easy to locate a particular funct-
 * ion because you just scan the functions from top to bottom in alphabetical order. Nonstatic functions are
 * functions that are intended to be called from other source code files, so they are already declared in the
 * corresponding header file (which *is* included) so the function definitions can be written in any order in
 * the source code file because the declarations will be seen first (because they are sucked in with the header
 * file). Static functions do not have declarations in the header file (why?) so I write declarations for the
 * static functions near the top of the source code file above all of the function definitions. Now I can call
 * any static function from any static/nonstatic function without the compiler bitching at me about the
 * function being undefined.
