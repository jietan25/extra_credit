$ vigenere -h
Vigenere Cipher Version 1.0 

Encrypts or decrypts a message using the Vigenere cipher.

Usage: vigenere mode [-h] -k keyfile [-v]

If performing encryption (mode = e), the plaintext is read from stdin and the ciphertext is
written to stdout. If performing decryption (mode = d), the ciphertext is read from stdin and
the plaintext is written to stdout. Modes are:

	e  Encrypt the plaintext to produce the ciphertext using the specified key.
	d  Decrypt the ciphertext to produce the plaintext using the specified key.
Options:
	-h  Displays this help message and terminates without further processing.
	-k  Reads the key from 'keyfile'.
	-v  Displays version info and terminates without further processing.
